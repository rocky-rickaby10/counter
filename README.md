# Counter
A simple counter tool that was in a simple HTML websites project list. I'm hosting it here on GitHub because it's actually useful. 

## Notes
The icon is a version of a Google Fonts icon located [here](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material%20Symbols%20Outlined%3Aswap_vert%3AFILL%400%3Bwght%40400%3BGRAD%400%3Bopsz%4024) modified using Kleki.
